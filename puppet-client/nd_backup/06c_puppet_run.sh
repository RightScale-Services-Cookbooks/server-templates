#
#   PUPPET_DEBUG:
#       If enabled, Puppet is run in full debug mode with very loud and verbose
#       output. This should only be used when troubleshooting, and never for
#       general purpose work.
#
#   PUPPET_REPORT:
#       If disabled, then Puppet will be configured to not send failure reports
#       to the admin team. This should only be used during debugging.
#
#   PUPPET_ENVIRONMENT:
#       The Puppet environment to use.
#       configuration.
