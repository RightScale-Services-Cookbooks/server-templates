Name: RightLink 10.6.0 Chef IIS Test
Description: |
  Base ServerTemplate for RightLink10. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect
  servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to
  install. _It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 or prior
  versions._ See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.

  This base ST includes a few boot scripts that:

  * Wait for an EIP to settle (AWS only)
  * Sets up RightLink10 automatic upgrades
  * Enables RightScale OS monitoring.

  It has an operational script to force a RightLink10 upgrade. And we also
  provide a decommission script that provides the reason for shutdown. The
  source of the scripts on this ServerTemplate is available at
  [https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.5.3](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.5.3).

  __This ServerTemplate is only meant to be used to enable existing servers or
  to boot up new custom created images via RightScale. It is not intended to be
  booted with the included images, they are only supplied as reference for what
  was used for validation.__

  The images included are stock/official images made available by the cloud
  provider or the OS developer. Therefore they can be deregistered and made
  unavailable at any time at the discretion of the owner. It is advised that you
  create your own MultiCloud Image with your own custom image for Linux or
  Windows. Please refer to [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images)

  Some of the images included may require you to accept terms of service before
  using the image. Please follow the instructions provided in the error message
  during launch or refer to the OS compatibility link above.
